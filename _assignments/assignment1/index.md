# Overview

You are to propose a __problem__ and an __approach__ that could form the basis of a project for this course.
Successful projects will observe the need for good human-centered design in an interactive computing system, 
analyze the needs and opportunities in the problem, explore potential designs, and propose a compelling solution.

This assignment is worth __3%__ of your overall course grade:

- __0.5%__ for the proposal brainstorm
- __0.5%__ for the initial project proposal
- __2.0%__ for the revised project proposal

# Milestones

This is an individual assignment, consisting of three milestones.

  Due: Uploaded the night before class {{ page.date_project_1b }}
  
* [Assignment 1c: Revised Project Proposal](#project_proposal_revised)

# Project Description

The theme for projects in this course is __community support and engagement__. Current widely used examples of community support and engagement systems exist in a variety of domains:

- Social Networking
  - [Nextdoor](https://nextdoor.com/) (private social networks for neighbors)
  - [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/) (sharing reading interests with friends)
- Sub-community Discovery
  - [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/) (organizing in-person meetings of people with similar interests within a locality)
- Civic Engagement
  - [Living Voters Guide](https://livingvotersguide.org/) (informing voters on current ballot issues)
- Community Participation
  - [Facebook's Nearby Friends](https://www.facebook.com/help/629537553762715/) (encourages engaging with friends in-person)

Researchers have also studied current processes, challenges, and opportunities:

- [Dillahunt et al., 2014, Understanding factors of successful engagement around energy consumption between and among households]({{ site.baseurl }}/readings/Community-Dillahunt2014.pdf)
- [Sheena Erete, 2015, Engaging Around Neighborhood Issues: How Online Communication Affects Offline Behavior]({{ site.baseurl }}/readings/Community-Erete2015.pdf)
- [MÃ¼ller et al., 2015, Practice-based Design of a Neighborhood Portal: Focusing on Elderly Tenants in a City Quarter Living Lab]({{ site.baseurl }}/readings/Community-Muller2015.pdf)

## Thinking Big
 
Your proposal must go beyond a technology-centric proposal of a webpage, phone application, or interaction. Think about 
the problems that people face in their lives with regards to their community, how we can approach those problems, and the role for interactive computing.
This first assignment is your opportunity to think broadly about identifying a problem. Subsequent assignments will provide 
opportunities to focus on designing a specific technological solution to a specific set of tasks.

You should identify and consider goals and activities that are important to people. Potential domains include:

 - social networking
 - civic engagement
 - sub-community discovery
 - crime prevention
 - community development
 
Activities within community engagement vary widely. Some examples include:

 - communicating with people
 - tracking neighborhood information
 - exploring a physical community
 - sharing community knowledge

Do not start with a focus on concrete one-time tasks (e.g., logging into your bank account). 
Instead identify problems in long-lived activities that span many different social or technological contexts. 
If you want to help people connect with neighbors, do not immediately propose a website that addresses one specific task. 
Consider the range of other opportunities (e.g., personal mobile devices, shared family computers, public/ambient displays).

Focus on creating or improving a specific application or service that addresses the issues of an actual community. 
You must be able to create and evaluate a design within the timeframe of this course, so consider whether you 
can reasonably gain access to the necessary people. We encourage you to think big, expanding upon your application 
to include new ideas for interaction techniques or technology platforms. 

Do not feel constrained by current devices, but instead aim to explore an exciting design that could potentially 
motivate the development of new enabling technology. For example, see how Artefact presents the Dialog concept:

- [Dialog: Better Decisions, Better Health - Artefact](http://www.artefactgroup.com/content/work/dialog/)
- [Video of Dialog Talk in DUB Seminar](http://vimeo.com/103167385)

This design has not been implemented, and might not even be immediately possible.
But it has been developed in substantial detail, understanding implications for design and implementation.

# Deliverables

<a name="project_brainstorm"></a>

## 1a: Project Brainstorm

Due: Uploaded the night before section {{ page.date_project_1a }}

Friday's section will focus on brainstorming potential project directions.
You will get started on thinking, and help seed this brainstorming, with some individual ideas.

Propose three starting points for brainstorming domains, problems, and goals that fall within the realm of community support and engagement.

By domain, we mean an aspect of a physical community. Domains that are already common in community support and engagement include:

- social networking (e.g., meeting neighbors, sharing common knowledge important to the community)
- civic engagement (e.g., engaging in local politics, informing citizens of issues that affect their community)
- sub-community discovery (e.g., bringing people together)
- crime prevention (e.g., understanding and acting to prevent crime within neighborhoods)
- community development (e.g. volunteerism)

Be sure to focus on problems and goals, not potential design solutions.
One way to help yourself identify a hierarchy of problems and goals is to ask "why?". For example:

- Why is a person using Nextdoor? 
- Why is a person reading their neighbors posts?
- Why do they want to know what issues their neighbors are dealing with?
- Why are they replying to neighbors posts?

Each idea should be a single sentence, identifying the domain and the problem or goal.
At most one of your ideas may come from any of the domains above.
You other two ideas should be from domains not in this list, in order to broaden the brainstorm.
Ensure the ideas are significantly different, not small variations on the same idea.

### Submission

No more than one page of text in PDF format. Submit via Canvas here: 

{% if page.link_project_1a != nil %}<{{ page.link_project_1a }}>{% else %}`Link to be added`{% endif %}

If you are still attempting to add, or otherwise unable to access the submission system, submit via the instructor email address.

In section, be prepared to contribute your initial ideas as part of a larger brainstorm.

### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __5 points__: One point for each unique proposed idea (i.e., do not submit small variations on the same idea) and 2 points for creativity.

## 1b: Project Proposal

Due: Uploaded the night before class {{ page.date_project_1b }}

With your assigned project groups, propose and analyze a problem that forms the basis of a design project for this class.

In one paragraph, describe the design problem and motivation. 
This description should convince the reader that this is a difficult and interesting problem, worth spending a quarter considering. 
State what the problem is and why it is a problem, or describe a new idea and why it will enhance an existing application or practice.

In another paragraph, analyze the problem or idea to give more background and context. 
Do not just focus on the negative aspects of the current situation, but also identify some positive aspects that may be beneficial to retain. 
A few salient examples from existing systems or practices could be used to support those claims.
If appropriate, you may conduct this analysis by describing a scenario that illustrates how someone might encounter and resolve the problem.

Ensure your report is appropriately clear and easy to read. This includes:

 - text should be clear and concise
 - use section headings as appropriate
 - include images in the body of the write-up with appropriate figure numbers and captions
 - refer to the figures in the body of your text
 - check for typos, spelling, and grammar errors

Be sure your presentation looks good:

 - choose appropriate colors, fonts, and styles
 - make liberal use of whitespace
